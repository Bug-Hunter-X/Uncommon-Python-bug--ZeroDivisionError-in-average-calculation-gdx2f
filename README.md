This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed bug in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers: the ZeroDivisionError.  The bug occurs when attempting to calculate the average of an empty list, resulting in division by zero.  The solution addresses this by explicitly checking for empty lists and returning an appropriate value (0 in this case) to prevent the error.
